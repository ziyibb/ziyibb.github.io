Hello! I am Ziyi. I am a master student in [Institute of Research and Higher Education Studies in Tourism](https://irest.pantheonsorbonne.fr/bienvenue-lirest) at [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/). Previously, I obtained my BA in linguistic from [Université Sorbonne](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and BMgt in tourism management from [Beijing Forestry University](http://english.bjfu.edu.cn/). 

I reaserch in China inbound tourism. I enjoy travalling, watching films and riding bicycle. I like sea.

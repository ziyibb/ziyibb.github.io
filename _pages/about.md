Hello! I am Ziyi. I am a master student at [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/). Previously, I obtained my BA in linguistic from [Université Sorbonne](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and BMgt in tourism management from [Beijing Forestry University](http://english.bjfu.edu.cn/). 

I reaserch in international tourism of China. I enjoy travalling around the world and watching films. I like sea.
